subagents — in parallel on the std.Io thread pool. It also compacts its own
context when the conversation gets long.

## Install

### Desktop app — macOS (Apple Silicon)

Prefer a window over a terminal? Download the latest signed, notarized build, drag it to Applications, and open it. On first launch it installs a `codegraff` launcher on your PATH, so `codegraff <path>` opens that folder in the app (`code`-style). For the `graff` agent CLI itself, use the command-line install below — the desktop app runs whatever `graff` is on your PATH.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/justrach/codegraff/releases/latest"><img alt="Download Codegraff for macOS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20for%20macOS-Apple%20Silicon-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&logoColor=white"></a>
</p>

### Command line — macOS · Linux

Grab the latest prebuilt release binary — macOS builds are Developer ID signed
and Apple notarized; on any other platform the installer builds from source with
Zig 0.16:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/justrach/codegraff/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

From a checkout, just run `./install.sh`. The binary lands in `~/bin` by default
(override with `HARNESS_DIR`):

| tool      | purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `graff`   | the agent CLI + REPL — the one binary this script installs |
| `codedb`  | optional code-intelligence companion (structural search/outline/callers). graff auto-detects it and points at the [one-line install](https://github.com/justrach/codedb) if it's missing; everything else works without it |

### Give it a key

Three ways — pick whichever is easiest:

```sh
graff login                     # free codegraff key (device-code OAuth, no signup forms)
graff key set deepseek sk-...   # store ANY provider's key (macOS Keychain, else 0600 file)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...  # or just an env var (env always wins)
```

Already logged into the Codex CLI? Skip this step — your ChatGPT subscription is
picked up automatically from `~/.codex/auth.json`. Or run `graff login codex`.

> **Note on `login`:** there is no per-provider `login` command. `graff login`
> is *specifically* the free codegraff key, and `graff login codex` is the
> ChatGPT-subscription OAuth. **Every other provider** (deepseek, openai,
> anthropic, kimi, xai, zai, minimax, xiaomi) is a key — set it with
> `graff key set <provider> <key>` or its `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` env var, then
> select a model with `--model` / `/model`. See [Providers & models](#providers--models).

### Run it

```sh
graff                            # starts on the first provider you have a key for
graff --model deepseek-reasoner  # or pin one explicitly
```

First things to try once you're at the `›` prompt:

```
› what's in this directory? summarize the build setup.
› /model sonnet                  # fuzzy-switches to claude-sonnet-4-6
› spawn three subagents to summarize src/, count TODOs, and check git status — in parallel
› ultracode audit this repo for error-handling gaps   # codeword → multi-agent workflow mode
› /help                          # everything else
```

## Why

Measured, not vibes — arm64 macOS, ReleaseFast; methodology and the budgets each
change is held to live in [architecture.md](architecture.md):

| metric                      | measured                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| binary                      | **1.69 MB**, zero dependencies (Zig std only)   |
| cold start                  | **~1.4 ms**                                     |
| full agentic turn           | **12 MB** peak RSS, ~4% CPU (network-bound)     |
| 8 parallel subagents        | **+0.4 MB each** (15 MB total)                  |
| tool output into history    | hard 128 KB cap — a 500 MB python child process never touches the harness's footprint |

Benchmarked against the Rust codegraff ([justrach/codegraff](https://github.com/justrach/codegraff),
39 MB binary, 934 crates) on the *same model through the same endpoint*,
interleaved 3×: turn speed was a dead tie (2.94 s vs 2.93 s — the network and
the model dominate the turn), but the Zig harness ran in **4.3× less memory**
(11.3 MB vs 48.5 MB), starts 3.5× faster, and is 23× smaller on disk. An agent
CLI rarely wins on turn speed; it can win on the cost of being there.

## Code intelligence — token-efficient by default

The fastest way to blow a context window is to read whole files into it. graff
ships with a built-in **`codedb`** tool — read-only, structural code
intelligence over a local index of the repo
([github.com/justrach/codedb](https://github.com/justrach/codedb)) — and the
system prompt steers the model to reach for it *before* `grep` or
whole-file reads. Instead of paying for a 2,000-line file to find one function,
the model asks for exactly the shape it needs:

```
codedb outline src/main.zig          # just the symbol map — functions/types, no bodies
codedb symbol switchProvider --body  # one function, by name
codedb callers recordUsage           # who calls it (call sites, not files)
codedb search "parse SSE"            # indexed search — ranked hits, not a grep dump
codedb context "add a new provider"  # task-shaped orientation across the codebase
```

Why this keeps token cost low:

- **Structural slices, not files.** `outline`/`symbol`/`callers`/`deps` return a
  function map or a single definition — tens of lines where a `read_file` would
  spend thousands. The index is queried, not the raw bytes streamed into history.
- **It's free and indexed; the metered tools come second.** The system prompt
  encodes an explicit search order — try the free, indexed `codedb` first;
  fall to (metered) `muonry`/raw search only for literal/regex or non-indexed
  files. The cheap path is the default path.
- **Hard output cap.** A query is truncated at **64 KB** with a marker that nudges
  the model back toward targeted queries (`outline`, `symbol --body`) rather than
  whole-file reads — so even a broad search can't balloon the context.
- **Same index powers the `@` file picker** (`codedb glob`), so attaching a file
  by name never shells out to a directory walk.

Pure-Zig client to a pure-Zig server, zero dependencies on either side. Allowed
subcommands: `search · symbol · callers · find · outline · read · tree ·
context · word · deps · glob · ls · file · hot`. Not installed? The tool says so
and points at the one-line install; everything else keeps working without it.

---

## An evolutionary harness

graff doesn't just run an agent — it records every run as a node in a
**Darwin Gödel Machine-style archive tree** ([arXiv:2505.22954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954)),
so the harness itself is the substrate for agent self-improvement. Each session
appends to `harness.trajectory.jsonl` (Claude Code-style JSONL, but as a
lineage tree):

- **A lineage tree, not a flat log.** Root turns form a spine (each turn's
  parent is the previous one); every subagent and workflow task hangs off the
  turn that spawned it. Each node carries a **fingerprint of the system prompt
  it ran with** (`prompt_sha` = first 8 bytes of SHA-256), so prompt mutations —
  `set_system_prompt` on the spine, per-child `system_prompt` overrides on the
  fan-out — show up as hash changes along edges. A lineage can be replayed or
  scored offline.
- **Personas are variants.** Subagents pick a persona with `agent` (built-ins:
  `reviewer · researcher · implementer · skeptic`, plus anything in
  `.harness/agents/`) or take a custom `system_prompt`; either way the
  trajectory records the lineage, so you can mine *which agent variant actually
  worked*.
- **A fitness ledger with integrity.** The `score` channel appends evaluation
  records (`prompt_sha`, `score`, `parent_sha` — the lineage edge DGM parent
  selection counts children with). Because the archive lives in the working
  directory, a forged `score` row could manufacture fitness — so every score the
  harness writes is **HMAC-signed** (keyed by `GRAFF_SCORE_KEY_FILE`, a secret
  outside the cwd that the evolving agent's confined tools can't reach). Readers
  recompute the HMAC and reject unsigned or forged rows. Signing is opt-in and
  backward-compatible (no key → unsigned, accepted as before).
- **Tool-use + usage are mined too.** Each agent logs its tool calls (name +
  error flag, in order) plus a `usage` object with API calls, input/cache/output
  tokens, subscription/unpriced call counts, and estimated `cost_usd` — the same
  practical accounting Claude Code's trajectories enable, but attached to every
  turn/subagent node and joinable to scores via `prompt_sha`.
- **Closed loop in releases.** Release binaries ship anonymous evolution
  telemetry (opt-out) so agent-variant fitness is learned across the fleet, not
  just one laptop. `/trajectory` renders the current session's agent tree; see
  [docs/hyperagents.md](docs/hyperagents.md) for the full design.

## Providers & models

Six API-key providers plus a subscription login, three wire formats. A
`ProviderSpec` table (`provider_specs` in `src/main.zig`) holds each provider's
endpoint, auth style, env var, and default model; base URLs and key names come
from [models.dev](https://models.dev)'s `api.json` (snapshot 2026-06-10).

| Provider    | Wire format / auth          | Key env var          |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages, x-api-key | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  |
| `codegraff` | OpenAI chat, bearer         | `CODEGRAFF_API_KEY` (`cg_sk_...`) |
| `deepseek`  | OpenAI chat, bearer         | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`   |
| `openai`    | OpenAI chat, bearer         | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     |
| `minimax`   | Anthropic Messages, bearer  | `MINIMAX_API_KEY`    |
| `xiaomi` (MiMo) | OpenAI chat, bearer     | `XIAOMI_API_KEY`     |
| `kimi` / `xai` (grok) / `zai` (GLM) | OpenAI chat, bearer | `KIMI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` / `ZAI_API_KEY` (via `graff key set`) |
| `codex`     | Responses API, ChatGPT login | `~/.codex/auth.json` (no env var) |

**Using a specific provider directly** is always the same two steps — give it
the key, then name a model. For example, DeepSeek straight to `api.deepseek.com`:

```sh
graff key set deepseek sk-...          # or: export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
graff --model deepseek-reasoner        # models: deepseek-v4-pro · deepseek-v4-flash · deepseek-chat · deepseek-reasoner
```

The same pattern works for every API-key row above — swap in the provider id
and one of its models (`graff key set openai sk-...` → `--model gpt-...`,
`graff key set anthropic sk-ant-...` → `--model sonnet`, and so on).

A model is routed to the first provider (in the table order above) that both has
a key set **and** lists the model in `model_table`. Unknown `claude*` models
fall back to Anthropic; any other unknown model falls back to the codegraff
gateway — and `/model` prints a warning when that fallback fires, since a typo'd
name will be rejected by the API on the first request. The startup default is
the first provider with a key, on its default model. `/models` prints the full
table — context window, compaction point, provider, and which providers you have
keys for; `/model <name>` switches (a bare `/model` opens an interactive fuzzy
picker).

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex login (ChatGPT subscription)</strong> · <strong>why no Claude login</strong></summary>

<br/>

If you're logged into the Codex CLI, the harness reads the ChatGPT OAuth token
from `~/.codex/auth.json` at startup (the same on-disk-credential trick used for
the codegraff key) and prints `logged into Codex (ChatGPT account …)`. Switch to
it with `/model gpt-5.5` (or `gpt-5-codex`). This is a third wire format — the
**Responses API** against the ChatGPT backend
(`chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`), not `api.openai.com` — so it uses
your ChatGPT Pro/Plus subscription rather than a paid API key. Text, tool
calling, compaction, and `/save`/`/resume` all work on it. Not logged in?
`graff login codex` runs the PKCE browser flow itself.

Claude models route through a real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or the codegraff gateway
only — there is deliberately no Claude-subscription login: reusing a Claude Code
OAuth token outside the official client violates Anthropic's terms of service.

Tool definitions are written once as comptime specs and rendered into both
formats (Anthropic `input_schema` vs OpenAI `function.parameters`) at compile
time — see `anthropicToolsJson` / `openaiToolsJson` in `src/main.zig`.

## CLI reference

```
usage:
  graff [flags]                    start the REPL
  graff [-p] "prompt"              one-shot: run the prompt, print the answer, exit
  graff login                      get a codegraff key (device-code OAuth)
  graff login codex [--refresh]    ChatGPT/Codex OAuth login (PKCE)
  graff key set <provider> <key>   store a key (macOS Keychain, else 0600 file)
  graff key list                   show which providers have keys
  graff --schema                   print the machine-readable interface (SDK codegen)

flags:
  --model <name>   start on this model (same fuzzy resolution as /model)
  --yolo           skip all permission prompts for the session
  -p, --print      one-shot print mode (answer on stdout, tool progress on stderr)
  --timing         show per-tool wall-clock on result lines (✓ (312ms) …)
  --cost           show running session spend in the prompt ([model · 12k tok · $0.0042])
  --json           structured stdio protocol (JSON in, JSONL events out — SDK transport)
  -h, --help       usage
  -V, --version    version
```

Unknown flags are an error (with a pointer to `--help`), a missing `--model`
value is an error, and `--help`/`--version` are handled before subcommand
dispatch — so `graff login --help` prints usage instead of starting an OAuth
flow. With no key configured at all, startup fails with the three quickest fixes
spelled out rather than a bare env-var list.

**One-shot mode** makes the harness scriptable without the SDK: `graff -p "how
many TODOs in src/?"` runs a full agentic turn (tools included), prints only the
final answer on stdout (progress lines go to stderr), and exits non-zero on
failure. There's no human to ask, so the permission gate denies anything not
already allowed — pre-approve commands in `.harness/settings.json` or pass
`--yolo`.

---

## REPL commands

A bare `/` opens the whole list as a filterable full-screen menu (type to
narrow, Enter runs it); **Esc during a response interrupts the turn** —
generation stops (it works from the moment the request is sent, including a slow
provider connect), what already streamed stays in history with an
`[interrupted]` marker, and you're back at the prompt. A bare Esc at the prompt
clears the input line.

```
/model [name]   no arg → interactive fuzzy picker; or /model <name|provider|provider model>
/models         list known models, context windows, compaction points
/clear          wipe the conversation and start fresh
/plan           toggle plan mode: read-only explore + propose; writes/edits denied
/key [p k]      show API-key status; /key <provider> <key> adds one live (+ Keychain)
/keepcontext    toggle keeping the conversation when /model switches wire format (default on)
/reasoning      codex/gpt-5 reasoning depth: low|medium|high (default high)
/rewind [n]     list past prompts; /rewind <n> drops prompt n+after & reverts its file edits
/image <path>   attach an image to your next message (vision models only)
/paste          attach the clipboard image (macOS); also Ctrl-V (⌘V can't be captured)
/strict         toggle "every message is a tool" mode
/yolo           toggle bash auto-approval (skip permission prompts)
/trace          toggle the JSONL event trace (harness.trace.jsonl)
/trajectory     show agent tree + token/cost totals (harness.trajectory.jsonl)
/compact        summarize history into a fresh context
/save | /resume | /sessions   session persistence; bare /resume → interactive picker
/todo           show the current task list
/mcp [add …]    list MCP servers/tools; /mcp add <name> <cmd> connects one live
/help           list commands
exit | /exit | ctrl-d | ctrl-c(empty)   quit
```

`/plan`, `/yolo`, and `/strict` change how the permission gate behaves for the
session — see [Permission modes](#permission-modes).

The line editor supports ↑/↓ history (persisted to `~/.simple-harness-history`),
Tab completion (commands, and model names after `/model `), and emacs-style
editing (Ctrl-A/E/W/U/K, Option+Delete, word moves). The selected model is
remembered in `~/.simple-harness-model` and resumed next launch
(`--model <name>` overrides; a remembered model that's no longer in the table is
ignored with a note). The prompt is a small statusline:
`[model · 12345/800k tok (1%) · ⚡cached · $0.0042]` — context used vs the
compaction budget, last cache hit, and session spend. Errors aim to be
actionable: `/resume nope` says the session file wasn't found and points at
`/sessions`; an unknown `/foo` points at `/help`.

---

## Permission modes

By default graff **asks before doing anything that can change your machine.**
File writes (`write_file`/`edit_file`), MCP tool calls, and any bash command
that isn't read-only stop at a permission gate:

```
⚠ rm -rf build/
[y]es once · [a]lways allow "rm" (saved to .harness/settings.json) · [n]o ›
```

- **y** runs it once · **a** runs it *and* remembers the rule · **n** denies it
  (the model is told and picks another path).
- **Always** appends a prefix rule to `.harness/settings.json` under `"allow"`,
  so that command never prompts again — this session or a future one. Pre-seed
  that file by hand to allow commands up front (it lives next to your hooks; the
  harness preserves the rest of the file).
- Read-only commands are auto-allowed and never prompt: `ls cat head tail wc
  grep rg pwd which file`, `git status|diff|log|show`, `zig build|fmt` — but
  only while every path stays inside the working directory (`cat /etc/passwd`
  still asks), and only as a plain command. A pipe, redirect, `&&`, or `$(…)`
  always prompts, so a second command can't be smuggled past a prefix match.

Three session-wide modes change the gate — set on the CLI, or flip them live in
the REPL:

| mode       | turn on              | what it does |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| **yolo**   | `--yolo` · `/yolo`   | Skip **every** prompt — bash, edits, and MCP all run without asking. For sandboxes, CI, and `-p`/`--json` runs where there's no human to answer. `--yolo` starts the session in it; `/yolo` toggles mid-session. |
| **plan**   | `/plan`              | Read-only: the model explores and *proposes* a plan; the gate hard-denies writes, edits, MCP, and any bash beyond the read-only seed (even your saved allow-list) until you `/plan` again to execute. The prompt shows a ` plan` badge. |
| **strict** | `/strict`            | "Every message is a tool" — the model must call exactly one tool per message and finish with `attempt_completion`. Useful for deterministic, scriptable agent loops. |

**One-shot mode** (`graff -p "…"` or `--json`) has no human to answer the
prompt, so the gate denies anything not already allowed — pre-approve commands
in `.harness/settings.json` or pass `--yolo`.

---

## SDKs — TypeScript & Python

graff is scriptable from your own code. `graff --json` is a structured stdio
protocol (JSON requests in, JSONL events out; `ask_user` is answered with a
structured `{"type":"answer","text":"...","cancelled":false}` line) and `graff --schema` prints the
machine-readable interface — and the **TypeScript and Python SDKs in
[`sdk/`](sdk/) are auto-generated from that schema**, so they never drift from
the binary. On every release tag a GitHub Action rebuilds, regenerates, fails if
the committed SDKs are stale, and publishes to npm (`@graff-new/sdk`) and PyPI
(`simple-harness-sdk`).

```python
# Python
from harness_sdk import Harness

with Harness(yolo=True, model="gpt-5.5") as h:
    print(h.ask("what is 2+2?"))
    for ev in h.chat("read foo.txt"):
        print(ev["type"], ev)
```

```ts
// TypeScript
import { Harness, runAgent } from "@graff-new/sdk";

// one-shot, streamed
for await (const ev of runAgent({ prompt: "summarize README.md", model: "gpt-5.5", yolo: true })) {
  if (ev.type === "text") process.stdout.write(ev.text);
  if (ev.type === "turn") console.log("\ncost $", ev.cost_usd);
}

// long-lived, multi-turn
const session = Harness.init({ model: "claude-opus-4-8", yolo: true }).session();
console.log(await session.ask("what files are here?"));
session.close();
```

Can't spawn a local process (edge runtimes, browsers, other machines)? Run
`graff serve` and both SDKs ship matching **remote clients** that drive it over
HTTP — `@graff-new/sdk/remote` (fetch-only: Workers/Deno/Bun/browsers) and
Python's `RemoteHarness` (stdlib only). Same method surface, same event stream.
See [`sdk/README.md`](sdk/README.md).

## Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Tools & the permission gate</strong></summary>

<br/>

| Tool                 | Kind     | Implementation                                            |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `bash`               | built-in | `std.process.run` → `/bin/sh -c`, stdout+stderr+exit code |
| `read_file`          | built-in | `Io.Dir.cwd().readFileAlloc` (256 KB cap)                 |
| `edit_file`          | built-in | exact string replace; unique match required unless `replace_all` |
| `write_file`         | built-in | `Io.Dir.cwd().writeFile`                                  |
| `codedb`             | built-in | shells out to [codedb](https://github.com/justrach/codedb) — read-only code-intel (search/symbol/callers/outline/…) |
| `subagent`           | built-in | this same agent loop, recursively (root agent only)       |
| `workflow`           | built-in | phases of parallel subagents; `{{prev}}` carries results forward (root only) |
| `todo_write`/`_read` | meta     | mutate/read the agent's own task list                     |
| `ask_user`           | meta     | ask the human a question; their reply returns as the result |
| `attempt_completion` | meta     | carry the final answer out; ends the turn                 |
| `mcp__<server>__*`   | MCP      | tools discovered from `.mcp.json` servers (see below)     |

**Meta tools** act on the agent or the conversation, not the outside world, so
the orchestrator handles them inline rather than on a pool thread. `ask_user` +
`attempt_completion` make the human↔agent conversation fully tool-mediated: the
agent asks via a tool, the person's reply comes back as that tool's result, and
the agent finishes via another tool. In `/strict` mode the model is forced to
call a tool every turn, so *every* message is a tool call or tool result.

**Permission gate.** The gate (`gateTool`) covers `bash`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, and MCP tool calls — a call that isn't pre-approved prompts at the
REPL: `[y]es once · [a]lways allow "<key>" (saved) · [n]o`. The approval key is
the command's first word for bash, the tool name for writes/MCP. "Always"
**persists**: it's written to `.harness/settings.json` in the cwd
(`{"allow": ["touch", "write_file", …]}`) and loaded back on every launch in
that project — edit the file by hand to revoke or pre-approve. A small seed
allowlist (read-only basics like `ls`/`cat`/`rg`, plus `zig build`/`zig fmt` and
`git status`/`diff`/`log`/`show`) never prompts; `find` is deliberately excluded
(its `-exec`/`-delete` make it an exec tool). Commands containing chaining,
pipes, redirection, substitution, or newlines never match a prefix — they always
prompt. Approving an interpreter as a bash word (`python3`, `node`, …) prints a
heads-up that it grants arbitrary code execution.

**Path confinement.** `read_file`/`write_file`/`edit_file` are confined to the
working-directory subtree: no absolute paths, no `..`. This is structural (not
bypassed by `/yolo`) — `read_file /etc/shadow` and `write_file ../../x` are
refused with an error.

**bash is cwd-locked by default too.** A seed/approved command auto-runs only
when all its path arguments stay in the cwd (`escapesCwd` rejects absolute, `~`,
and `..` tokens). So `cat local.txt` runs free but `cat /etc/passwd` falls
through to a prompt at the root (you can still approve it per-call) and is denied
for subagents. `/yolo` lifts this.

**Subagents** have no stdin, so they're gated structurally, not by prompt: bash
is allowlist-only (unapproved → denied), file writes are allowed but
path-confined, and MCP isn't exposed to them at all. `/yolo` turns the prompt
gate off (path confinement stays).

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP servers</strong></summary>

<br/>

The harness is an MCP **client** (`src/mcp.zig`). Drop a `.mcp.json` in the
working directory and it spawns each server, speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio,
discovers their tools, and offers them to the model namespaced
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb":      { "command": "codedb", "args": ["mcp", "."] },
    "everything":  { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"] }
  }
}
```

Pointing it at `codedb mcp .` gives the agent 22 structural code-intelligence
tools — pure-Zig client to pure-Zig server, zero dependencies on either side.
`/mcp` lists what connected; `/mcp add <name> <cmd> [args…]` connects a server
live and saves it to `.mcp.json`. Workspace servers auto-connect only with
`--yolo` (trusted) or per-session consent.

One known companion is exempt from the workspace gate: if the `muonry` binary is
on PATH (the fast code-intelligence suite), the harness auto-connects it in
every workspace — it's a user-installed tool, not arbitrary repo config — and
injects its usage note so the model prefers `mcp__muonry__read`/`search` over
native navigation, falling back to the native tools whenever a call fails. Opt
out with `{"skills": {"muonry": false}}` in `.harness/settings.json`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ultracode & workflows — multi-agent fan-out</strong></summary>

<br/>

**ultracode — the multi-agent codeword.** Put the word **ultracode** anywhere in
a message and the harness augments that turn with a note steering the model into
multi-agent workflow mode: it prints `⚡ ultracode — multi-agent workflow mode
engaged`, records an `ultracode` trace event, and asks the model to fan the work
out across phases of parallel subagents (then synthesize) via the `workflow`
tool rather than doing it solo. It's a per-turn toggle — no flag, no mode to
remember, just the keyword.

**Workflows.** Dynamic workflows as data (inspired by pi-dynamic-workflows,
minus the JS sandbox): the model calls the `workflow` tool with a JSON plan — up
to 5 sequential phases, each holding up to 8 tasks that run in parallel as
isolated subagents. From phase 2 on, `{{prev}}` in a task prompt is replaced
with the labeled results of the previous phase (auto-appended if omitted), and
the final phase's results return to the root agent. Good for fan-out +
synthesis: audits, multi-perspective review, parallel research.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Subagents</strong></summary>

<br/>

A subagent is just a tool whose executor is the same `Agent` loop with a fresh
history, its own arena, and a subagent-specific system prompt (`execSubagent`).
Because tool calls already fan out via `io.async`, the model spawning three
subagents in one response gets three agent loops running concurrently, each
making its own HTTPS calls through the shared (thread-safe) `std.http.Client`.
Subagents inherit the parent's provider, so deepseek subagents work the same as
claude ones.

- Depth capped at one level: subagents don't get the `subagent` tool.
- Subagents don't share the root agent's context — the orchestrator must put
  everything needed into the prompt (the tool description tells it so).
- Progress lines (`[label] ⚙ bash …`) go to stderr via `std.debug.print`, which
  locks stderr and is safe from pool threads.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sessions & compaction</strong></summary>

<br/>

**Session persistence.** `/save [name]` writes the conversation (messages +
provider + strict flag) to `<name>.session.json` in the cwd (default name
`last`); `/resume [name]` restores it — provider, model, and full history — in
any later run, and `/sessions` lists the saved ones. The stored message array is
already the provider-native wire shape, so resume is a verbatim restore and
works across providers (including codex's Responses-format items).

**Compaction** — client-side, provider-agnostic:

1. Every response's `usage` is recorded (`input+output+cache` tokens for
   Anthropic, `total_tokens` for OpenAI) and shown in the prompt.
2. Past the model's compaction threshold — 80% of its context window, from a
   comptime model table (`/models` prints it: 800k for the 1M-context models,
   160k for `claude-haiku-4-5`, 160k fallback for unknown models) — or on
   `/compact`, the harness sends the history plus a handoff instruction *with no
   tools offered*, so the model must reply with a text summary covering goals,
   decisions, file paths, code state, and pending work.
3. History is replaced by a single user message embedding that summary, and the
   token counter resets.

If the summary request fails, history is left untouched.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>KV-cache efficiency (Manus lessons)</strong></summary>

<br/>

Following [Manus's context-engineering notes](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus),
the loop is built to keep the prompt prefix cacheable: the system prompt is
stable (no per-request timestamps), history is strictly append-only, and tool
definitions are rendered once at comptime so their order never shifts. On the
real Anthropic API the harness also sets an explicit `cache_control` breakpoint.
Cache reads are surfaced: `recordUsage` parses `cache_read_input_tokens`
(Anthropic) and `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` / `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`
(OpenAI/DeepSeek), and every `api` trace line carries a `cache_read_tokens` field
so you can see the hit rate in `harness.trace.jsonl`.

The one deliberate exception is `set_system_prompt` (--json protocol / SDK
`setSystemPrompt`): the system prompt is the *first* token of the cached prefix,
so mutating it — even appending — invalidates the KV-cache for the entire
conversation and the next request re-reads everything at full input price. Treat
it as a task-boundary operation: prefer the spawn-time
`--system-prompt`/`--append-system-prompt` flags, and never flip the prompt back
and forth inside an agent loop.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Tracing & telemetry</strong></summary>

<br/>

**Tracing — the harness can debug itself.** Every API round trip (latency,
request/response bytes, context tokens) and every tool execution (duration,
result size, errors, root-vs-subagent) is appended as one JSON line to
`harness.trace.jsonl` in the cwd, truncated at startup so it always covers the
current session. The system prompt tells the agent the file exists — so "profile
yourself" or "why was that slow?" makes the agent read its own trace and answer
from data. `/trace` toggles it.

**Telemetry — anonymous, opt-out in releases.** Official release binaries ship
with a default OTLP endpoint baked in (`-Dtelemetry-endpoint`), so they send
anonymous usage + evolution telemetry to the project's collector by default —
this is how install counts, model mix, and agent-evolution fitness are learned
across the fleet. **Opt out any time** with `--no-telemetry` or
`GRAFF_NO_TELEMETRY=1`. **Builds from source have no endpoint baked in and send
nothing** unless you set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or `GRAFF_OTEL_ENDPOINT`)
yourself; an env endpoint also overrides the release default. When live, the
session ships one best-effort OTLP/HTTP JSON POST to `<endpoint>/v1/logs` at exit
(plus mid-session batches): a `session` summary (duration, turns, API/tool
call+error counts, models used, workflow and ultracode counts), one record per
`workflow` run (phases, tasks, failures, wall-clock), and one per error (API
failure, aborted turn). Resource attributes carry an anonymous per-install id
(`~/.simple-harness-install-id`), version, OS, and arch — that id is how total
installs are counted. The generated SDKs tag their child harness with
`HARNESS_CLIENT=sdk-ts|sdk-py` plus their own id (`~/.simple-harness-sdk-id`), so
SDK users are counted separately from direct CLI users. A flush failure never
disturbs the session.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project instructions (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md)</strong></summary>

<br/>

At startup the harness reads the first of `AGENTS.md`, `HARNESS.md`, or
`CLAUDE.md` it finds in the working directory and appends it to the root system
prompt (subagents keep the lean prompt). It prints `loaded project instructions
from AGENTS.md (N bytes)`. Because the system prompt stays frozen for the
session, this is KV-cache-friendly. Drop conventions, codewords, or do/don't
rules in `AGENTS.md` and the harness picks them up like any real coding agent.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install details, keys & SDKs</strong></summary>

<br/>

`install.sh` compiles `graff` (ReleaseFast) and installs it to `~/bin` (override
with `HARNESS_DIR=`); it builds the current checkout, or clones the repo if run
standalone. It detects the platform (Windows → WSL hint), checks for Zig 0.16,
and ends with a PATH check. Alternatively, run in place:

```sh
zig build run            # or: ./zig-out/bin/graff
zig build test           # the test suite (also run by CI — .github/workflows/ci.yml)
```

**Releases & verification.** Tagged releases ship a prebuilt **darwin-arm64**
binary that is **codesigned with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by
Apple**, so it runs without Gatekeeper prompts. Verify a download:

```sh
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 graff   # → valid on disk; satisfies its Designated Requirement
codesign -dv --verbose=4 graff 2>&1 | grep Authority
#   Authority=Developer ID Application: Rachit Pradhan (WWP9DLJ27P)
```

Keys can come from env vars, or be stored safely with `graff key set <provider>
<key>` — on macOS in the login **Keychain** (service `simple-harness`),
elsewhere a `0600` `~/.simple-harness-keys.json`; the harness auto-loads them at
startup for any provider whose env var isn't set (env always wins). `graff key
list` shows which providers have a stored key. Providers
(OpenAI/Anthropic-format, matched to graff): anthropic, openai, deepseek,
**kimi**, **xai** (grok), **zai** (GLM), minimax, xiaomi, codegraff, plus the
codex & claude subscription logins.

`graff login` runs graff's codegraff device-code flow (a `user_code` to enter at
codegraff.com/cli/auth → poll → key, saved to `~/.simple-harness-codegraff.json`);
the codegraff key is also auto-picked-up from graff's own
`~/forge/.credentials.json` if present, so no env var is needed. `graff login
codex` runs the Codex/ChatGPT OAuth browser flow (PKCE → localhost callback →
token) and `graff login codex --refresh` refreshes it, both writing
`~/.codex/auth.json`.

**SDKs.** `graff --json` exposes a structured stdio protocol (JSON requests in,
JSONL events out) and `graff --schema` prints the machine-readable interface —
together the foundation for the auto-generated TypeScript + Python SDKs in
[`sdk/`](sdk/) (regenerated on release by `sdk/generate.py` /
`.github/workflows/sdk.yml`).

`graff serve` puts that same protocol on HTTP for clients that can't spawn a
local process (edge runtimes, browsers, other machines): each session is a real
`graff --json` child, one non-answer POST is one protocol request, and the
response streams NDJSON events until that request's terminal event. `answer`
POSTs can be sent while the original stream is waiting on `ask_user`; they ack
immediately and the original stream continues to the `tool_result`/`turn`.
Bearer auth via
`--token`/`HARNESS_SERVE_TOKEN` (required to bind beyond loopback); CORS opens
only when a token gates access. The SDKs ship matching remote clients —
`@graff-new/sdk/remote` (fetch-only: Workers/Deno/Bun/browsers) and Python's
`RemoteHarness` (stdlib urllib). Endpoints are documented under the `serve` key
of `graff --schema`.

<summary><strong>Why Zig & implementation notes</strong></summary>

<br/>

- An agent harness is I/O-bound, so you don't need an async runtime — but Zig
  0.16's new `std.Io` interface gives you one anyway: `io.async(fn, args)`
  returns a typed `Future`, executed on a thread pool you configure
  (`std.Io.Threaded`). Parallel tools and parallel subagents are the same ~6
  lines (see `runToolsParallel`).
- The new `pub fn main(init: std.process.Init)` entry point hands you `io`, a
  thread-safe gpa, a process-lifetime arena, and the environment map.
- Compiles in well under a second; the binary is self-contained (TLS included,
  no libcurl/openssl).
- The payoff is measurable: same model, same endpoint, the Rust codegraff burns 4.3×
  the memory and 23× the disk for an identical-speed turn — see [Why](#why) and
  `architecture.md` for the methodology.

Notes:

- UI/UX changes are tracked in [uxlog.md](uxlog.md) — what changed, what it
  replaced, and the design reasoning (newest first).
- Anthropic requests use adaptive thinking; the assistant's full `content` array
  (including thinking blocks and signatures) is echoed back verbatim, as the API
  requires for tool-use loops.
- OpenAI tool arguments arrive as *stringified* JSON and are parsed before
  dispatch; tool results go back as `role: "tool"` messages.
- History lives in an arena per agent; per-request buffers use the gpa.
- Root requests **stream**: text deltas print live as the SSE events arrive (all
  three wire formats), then the buffered events are reassembled into the
  non-streaming response shape so the rest of the loop is unchanged. Subagents
  and compaction stay buffered. `max_tokens: 16000`.

<summary><strong>Status & roadmap</strong></summary>

<br/>

Honest list of what the harness still lacks, roughly in the order it hurts.

**Foundational:**
1. ~~**A public repo + signed release.**~~ **Done — v0.0.1.** The repo is public at
   [`justrach/codegraff`](https://github.com/justrach/codegraff), and releases ship
   a prebuilt **darwin-arm64 binary that is codesigned (Developer ID) and notarized
   by Apple**. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) cross-compiles
   the rest on every `v*` tag; `install.sh` prefers the prebuilt download over a
   source build, so `curl … | bash` now installs in one command with no toolchain.
   command with no toolchain.

**Later:**

2. Windows support (install.sh punts to WSL today).
3. Shell completions (zsh/bash) and a man page.
4. A config file for defaults (`--timing`/`--cost`/model) so flags don't have to
   be retyped.
5. Esc during *tool execution* (the interrupt currently lands at the next
   stream; a long-running bash call still runs to completion).
6. Honor `Retry-After` on 429s (the backoff is plain exponential today).

Recently shipped: **v0.1.0** — tagged GitHub release with prebuilt darwin/linux
binaries · bash output truncates at its 128 KB cap instead of failing the tool
call (`runCapped`: real exit code, `[truncated]` marker, memory stays flat while
the child streams gigabytes) · measured performance budgets + the Rust-graff
bake-off in [architecture.md](architecture.md) · 429/5xx retry with exponential
backoff (1s·2ⁿ capped at 8s, Esc cancels the wait, `retry` notes in the trace) ·
`--version` stamped from `git describe` at build time (`-Dversion=X.Y.Z`
overrides) · Esc coverage from the moment the request is sent — no more `^[` echo
while a slow provider connects, and the interrupt lands before the first token ·
bare Esc at the prompt clears the line · one-shot `-p` print mode · persistent
approvals (`.harness/settings.json`) · plan mode (`/plan`) · `/clear` · bare-`/`
command menu · interactive `/resume` picker · context-% statusline.

## Coming soon

Active directions — see the **Status & roadmap** details above for the full
list, and the GitHub issues for what's in flight:

- **Sandboxes.** Run the agent's `bash`/file tools inside an isolated sandbox
  (ephemeral container / microVM) so untrusted or destructive steps can't touch
  the host — the natural next layer above today's cwd-confinement and permission
  gate, and the safe substrate for hands-off evolutionary runs.
- **Closing the evolution loop end-to-end** — a grounded judge, sync-back of
  fleet trajectories, and automatic promotion of winning agent variants.
- **Windows support, shell completions + man page, and a config file** for
  default flags/model.
